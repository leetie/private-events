This repo is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. You can find it [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lnav).
The purpose of this project was to practice associations with Rails' ActiveRecord by creating a site similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com) where users can make events, attend events, and send invitations to events.
